  bio: |
    Look, if you're reading this bio, you're either:
    1. A recruiter (hello 👋 please send interesting opportunities)
    2. A colleague checking if I wrote something embarrassing (I probably did)
    3. Actually interested (weird, but okay)

    I mostly deal with ERP systems, SQL databases, and the existential dread that comes with both. 
    I built these docs because I got tired of answering and asking the same questions.
    
    Fun fact: I've accidentally broken production exactly 3 times.
    Each time taught me something valuable (mainly: how to write better rollback scripts).

    If you need me, I'm probably:
    - Writing a SQL query that's longer than it should be
    - Explaining why we can't "just add that feature" to the ERP

    P.S. Yes, I know the ERP system is weird. We're working on it. Slowly.
