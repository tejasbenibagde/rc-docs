You know that feeling when you spend 30 minutes looking for that one SQL query someone wrote on a excel sheet 6 months ago?

Yeah, me too. That's why this docs exists.

## What This Actually Is

Think of this as our team's collective brain dump — but organized. Less chaos, more "oh, that's where we wrote that down."

We're putting all those:
- "How do I unfreeze a series again?" moments
- Random SQL fixes that actually worked
- Process guides we keep explaining to new folks
- Basically anything we don't want to forget (or explain twice)

## What It's NOT
- Super formal corporate documentation (no "synergistic paradigms" here)
- A replacement for actual training (sorry, still gotta do that)
- A magic fix for all our ERP problems (I wish)

## How to Actually Use This

1. **Stuck?** Try searching first. Might save you asking that question in the group chat.
2. **Fixed something weird?** Add it here. Your future self will thank you.
3. **Found a mistake?** Fix it. Or at least tell someone who can.

## The Real Goal

To spend less time:
- Asking the same questions
- Hunting for old emails
- Explaining processes from scratch

And more time:
- Actually fixing things
- To have some peace
- Going home on time
