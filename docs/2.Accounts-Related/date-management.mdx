# Opening & Freezing Dates (ERP)

This page explains how **freeze dates** work in ERP and how to change them safely using  
**Configuration Master (Form 04.004.04)**.

This is a **routine but sensitive task**. Small mistakes here can block users or unlock data you didn’t mean to.

## What is a Freeze Date?

A **Freeze Date** locks transactions **up to a certain date** for a specific series.

- Dates **on or before** the freeze date → ❌ locked  
- Dates **after** the freeze date → ✅ allowed

Freeze dates are usually applied **per series**, not globally.

---

## Where to Change It (Frontend)

**Form**: `04.004.04 – Configuration Master`  
**Path**: Main Menu → Configuration → Configuration Master

<!-- truncate -->

## Quick Steps (Most Common Flow)

1. Open **Configuration Master**
2. Enter or select the **Series**
3. Click **Show**
4. Click **Edit**
5. Update the **Freeze Date**
6. Save

That’s it — but read the rules below before touching anything.

## Detailed Flow (When You Need Context)

### 1. Load the Series
- Enter the **Series code**
- Click **Show**
- Verify you’re editing the correct entity & accounting year

### 2. Edit Configuration
- Click **Edit**
- Locate the **Freeze Date** field

### 3. Change Freeze Date
- Pick the required date
- Transactions **before or on this date** will remain frozen
- Changes only apply **after** the freeze date

:::warning
You **cannot modify** records dated **on or before** the freeze date.

## Freeze Date Logic (Read This Once)

:::info Example
If today is **25 Jan**  
Freeze Date = **22 Jan**

- 22 Jan and earlier → **Frozen**
- 23 Jan onwards → **Open**
:::

---

## Auto-Freeze Logic (If Enabled)

Some series auto-freeze based on a rolling rule.

:::info Example
Auto Freeze Days = 3  
Today = 25 Jan  

Auto Freeze Date = 25 − 3 = **22 Jan**
:::

If auto-freeze feels “off”, check database flags (below).
