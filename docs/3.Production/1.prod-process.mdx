    C --> D[Quality Check]
    D --> E[Branding]

    G --> H[WIP Verification]
    H --> I[Store]
    I --> J[Dispatch]
```

## 1. Pre-Production (Product Planning)

This phase defines what to make and how to make it.
No physical production starts before this is complete.

    title Pre-Production
    section Planning
        Idea Finalization : Management
        Feasibility Review : Production Team
    section Design
        Mould Design : Vendor
        Sample Creation : Prototype
    section Approval
        Quality Review
        Final Approval
```

### Key Activities

- Product idea finalized
- Production feasibility discussion
- Director-level approval
- Mould design & sample creation
- Sample review and modifications
- Final approval of product & mould

---

## 2. Production at Plant

Once approved, production starts at the plant.

### Steps
- Moulds are installed on machines
- Production starts as per plan
- Quality Department checks:
  - Product dimensions
  - Finish & appearance
  - Compliance with quality standards
- Branding Department:
  - Clicks product photos
  - Records videos
  - Prepares brochures & marketing material
  - Sends content to dealers

---

## 3. Production Entry & Stock Creation (ERP)

This is where ERP comes into play.

### ERP & Data Entry

```mermaid

    A[Production Completed] --> B[Data Entry]
    B --> C[Production Entry Form]
    C --> D{BOM Available?}
    D -->|Yes| E[Auto Material Calculation]
    D -->|No| F[Manual Entry]
    E --> G[Stock Updated]
    F --> G
```

### ERP Notes
- **Finished goods** are added to stock
- **BOM (Bill Of Materials)** usage is preferred:
  - Faster entries
  - Consistent consumption
  - Fewer errors

---

## 4. Mould Maintenance & Repairs

Mould issues are common and handled based on **severity**.

### Repair Strategy

- Minor issues → Fixed **in-house**
- Vendor repair only if:
  - Damage is major
  - Quality is impacted
- Goal: **Minimum downtime, maximum control**

---

## 5. Post-Production & Packaging

After production, goods move to packaging and verification.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Packaging] --> B[WIP Check]
    B --> C{Quantity}
    C --> D{Weight}
    D --> E{Stickers}
    E --> F{Variations}
    F -->|Pass| G[Store]
    F -->|Fail| H[Return to Packaging]
```

**WIP Verifies**
- Quantity per batch
- Weight accuracy
- Date & batch stickers
- Product variation inside boxes

## 6. Store & Dispatch

```mermaid

    Store->>Dispatch: Material handover
    Dispatch->>Dispatch: Prepare invoice/challan
    Dispatch->>Transport: Arrange shipment
    Transport->>Customer: Deliver goods
    Dispatch->>ERP: Update delivery status

```

**Responsibilities**
- Billing prepares invoice
- Store hands material to Dispatch
- Dispatch ships to dealers/customers
---

## 7. Costing & Accounts (Monthly)
This process runs **parallel** to production.
### Costing
- Calculated monthly
- Includes:
  - Raw material
  - Electricity
  - Maintenance
  - Labour
  - and more
- Cost is **never fixed**

### Accounts
- Verifies costing bills
- Matches ERP and financial data

---

## 8. Pricing & Dealer Margin

Pricing is finalized after cost validation.

**Pricing Principles**
- Company should not incur loss
- Dealer margin must be attractive
- Poor margin = poor sales
Each product has a **unique price** based on its cost structure.
